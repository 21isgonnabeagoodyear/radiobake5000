radiobake5000
copyright 2014 Thomas VanSelus
generates radiosity lightmaps using hemicubes on the GPU
not really useful as it does not save the lightmaps, but it was a fun project
requires shadermagic (https://github.com/21isgonnabeagoodyear/shadermagic) and sdl2
assuming shadermagic is in the parent directory, compile with gcc -g main.c -o main `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lGL  -I../shadermagic -lm
run main
push z to toggle between interactive and bake mode
click in bake mode to control the camera
wasd in any mode to fly
uvmap_rgba contains the starting light sources
radiomodel3.tmd is the scene, exporter.blend will export to that format
edgesplit everything before exporting, model must have vertex colors
